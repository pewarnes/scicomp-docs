How to actually respond to user support requests?
-------------------------------------------------

I've been asked before, "how do you actually respond to customer
support requests?".  There are some obvious answers (be polite, try to
answer, etc), but are there any specific references for research
computing / scientific computing support staff?  This page collects my
ideas after having done it formally and informally for years.

Unsorted notes:

- one person takes the lead in communication
- Start by talking with people about the big picture
  - their position
  - past work
  - what they expect to get out of the support
- many questions are actually about:
  - the environment setup



Levels of competence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers have all levels of existing competences and needs.  The more
you understand of this, the better you can assist - and it is needed
to frame any response.


- Understand the level that the requestor is at and the level they
  need to be at
- An answer far below their level is demeaning
- An answer far above their level is demotivating
- It can be hard to know the level to answer, so multiple levels of
  answer are useful: one general paragraph, then one more detailed
  paragraph properly connected.

  may help to guide your thoughts in evaluating this.



General guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Think about what the underlying need is (X, not the Y)
* Be verbose (or at least not short).

  * If your answer is "no", it feels better to say it with many words,
    rather than few.
  * Verbosity is a sign of engagement, which makes the customer feel
    respected no matter if the verbosity is useful to them or not.

* **Service gesture**: something more than people expect (beyond the
  minimum that they asked).  (example: try harder to find someone who
  *can* answer, point them to that person.)



Know your audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The more you know about the very work of the person, the faster and
  better you can answer questions.
- This is a more direct lesson for the people managing support, but
  can you do anything about it yourself, too?



Consider at what level someone needs support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Do they need single answers to a question?
* Are they very lost and need to work with someone to implement it?

  * If you answer small questions piece-by-piece this is inefficient
    hill-climbing.
  * Direct to a RSE service for more support?

* Do they need a tutorial, reference, theoretical explanation, or
  how-to (the 4 types of docs).  These are all very different types of
  answers or links.



XY problem
~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't assume that what someone asks for is what they really need -
  you need to read between the lines.
- This isn't their fault, maybe they don't know what they need.
- Possible mitigations:

  - When replying, state your assumptions in your response so that they
    can correct you if they notice it wrong (if this is relevant).
  - Also consider stating several other possibilities briefly, and
    when they would be relevant.  For example: "Do XXX to install the
    software.  But do you know that you can also load it via the YYY
    module?"



Accept that you can't do everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make this decision explicit, not implicit.
- An implicit decision here means it is made based on internal biases.
- Better to discuss among the team to make sure it is consistent.



Giving bad news
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you have to say "no"

- Again, be more verbose rather than less
- Acknowledge the X and the Y of the initial request, so that they
  know the request really isn't possible (rather than "you not
  understanding").
- State why it's not possible, in more or less words.
- Can you turn this into an X-Y answer - find what they really need,
  that you (or someone) can do?



Dealing with mis-directed issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* It can be frustrating when someone asks the wrong place
* If you need to be nicer than just saying "no", since you have
  presumably already understood what the issue is, you actually can
  give useful pointers to where to ask next.  This itself may be a
  useful answer to them.

* Can you give keywords / a copy-paste text that explain the actual
  problem, that they can send to the other support you are now
  directing them to.  This:

  - Save the other staff time (they don't have to do the X-Y analysis
    themselves)
  - Save the customer time in thinking about what to say
  - Makes the customer feel valued and validated
